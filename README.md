# EchoBot

EchoBot is a small chatbot that repeats everything you say to it in a chatbox/widget. Written in React and Tailwind CSS. - Created a chat widget to allow the user to send messages to EchoBot.
- Includes a text input field for users to stay alive.
- Includes a send button that allows users to send statements to EchoBot.
- Added a message list that prints _historical_ messages from both the user and EchoBot.

# Updates in v0.1

- Fixed the _historical_ attribute of messages from both the user and Echobot.
- Fixed the way the _historical_ attribute only plays the hour and minute.
- Improved code lines.

# To run the project
